In this example, we will consider an iron cylinder with copper wires wound around the cylinder, as shown below

![Cross section of wires](wire.png)

Through the copper wires a static current of $J=1A$ is flowing.
We would like to compute the magnetic field $B$ in the iron cylinder, the copper wires, and the surrounding vaccum. 

We start by simplifying the problem to a 2D problem. We can do this by assuming that the cylinder extends far along the z-axis and as a consequence the field is virtually independent of the z-coordinate. 
Next, we consder Maxwell's equation to derive a Poisson equation for the magnetic field (or rather its potential)

$$
\nabla \cdot D = \rho,
$$
$$
\nabla \cdot B = 0,
$$
$$
\nabla \times E = -\frac{\partial B}{\partial t},
$$
$$
\nabla \times H = \frac{\partial D}{\partial t}+ J.
$$

Here, $D$ is the displacement field, $B$ is the magnetic field, $E$ is the electric field, and $H$ is the magnetizing field.
In addition to Maxwell's equation, we need a constitutive relation between $B$ and $H$,

$$
B =\mu H,
$$

which holds for an isotropic linear magnetic medium. 
Here, $\mu$ is the magnetic permability of the material. 
Now, since $B$ is solenodial (divergence free) accoording to Maxwell's equations, we known that $B$ must be the curl of some vector field $A$. This field is called the magnetic vector potential. Since the problem is static and thus $\frac{\partial D}{\partial t}=0$, it follows that

$$
J = \nabla \times H = \nabla \times(\mu^{-1} B)=\nabla \times (\mu^{-1}\nabla \times A ) = -\nabla \cdot (\mu^{-1}\nabla A).
$$

In the last step, we have expanded the second derivatives and used the gauge freedom of $A$ to simplify the equations to a simple vector-valued Poisson equation for the magnetic vector potential; if $B=\nabla \times A$, then $B=\nabla \times (A+\nabla \phi)$ for any scalar field $\phi$ (the gauge function).
For the current problem, we thus need to solve the following 2D Poisson problem for the $z$-component $A_z$ of the magnetic vector potential

$$
    - \nabla \cdot (\mu^{-1} \nabla A_z) = J_z \qquad \text{in } \mathbb{R}^2,\\
$$
$$
\lim_{\vert(x,y)\vert\to \infty}A_z = 0.
$$

Since we cannot solve the problem on an infinite domain, we will truncate the domain using a large disk, and set $A_z=0$ on the boundary. The current $J_z$ is set to $+1$A in the interior set of the circles (copper-wire cross sections) and to $-1$ A in the exteriror set of circles in the cross section figure.
Once the magnetic field vector potential has been computed, we can compute the magnetic field $B=B(x,y)$ by

$$
    B(x,y)=\left(\frac{\partial A_z}{\partial y}, - \frac{\partial A_z}{\partial x} \right).
$$

The weak formulation is easily obtained by multiplication of a test function $v$, followed by integration by parts, where all boundary integrals vanishes due to the Dirichlet condition, we obtain $a(A_z,v)=L(v)$ with

$$
a(A_z, v)=\int_\Omega \mu^{-1}\nabla A_z \cdot \nabla v ~\mathrm{d}x,
$$
$$
L(v)=\int_\Omega J_z v~\mathrm{d} x.
$$
## Meshing a complex structure with subdomains

We create the domain visualized in the cross section figure above using gmsh. Note that we are using the `gmsh.model.occ.fragment` commands to ensure that the boundaries of the wires are resolved in the mesh.

## Visualizing the magnetic field
"""
As the magnetic field is a piecewise constant vector field, we need create a custom plotting function.
We start by computing the midpoints of each cell, which is where we would like to visualize the cell-wise constant vector.
Next, we take the data from the function `B`, and  shape it to become a 3D vector.
We connect the vector field with the midpoint by using `pyvista.PolyData`.
