class Edge:
    """
    The edge class provides the functionality to represent the edges in the graph.

    Edges are used to keep track of the dependencies betweeen the nodes in the graph and
    are important for the backpropagation of the gradients. To this end, the edges store
    the adjoint equations to calculate the derivative of the successor node with respect
    to the predecessor node.

    Calling an edge will perform the backpropagation of the graph, by calculating the adjoint
    value and passing it to the edges connected to the predecessor node.

    Attributes:
        predecessor (Node): The predecessor node of the edge
        successor (Node): The successor node of the edge
        next_functions (list): The list of the gradient functions that are connected to the edge
        ctx (Any): The context variable of the edge
        input_value (float or PETSc.Vec): The input value of the edge

    Methods:
        set_next_functions: Sets the next functions in the path of the edge
        calculate_adjoint: Calculates the default adjoint equation for the edge
