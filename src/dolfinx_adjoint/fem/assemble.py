    Assemble functional. The returned value is local and not accumulated across processes.

    The overloaded function adds the functionality to keep track of the dependencies
    in the computational graph. The original functionality is kept.

    Args:
        args: Arguments to :py:func:`dolfinx.fem.assemble_scalar`.
        kwargs: Keyword arguments to :py:func:`dolfinx.fem.assemble_scalar`.
        graph (graph, optional): An additional keyword argument to specifier whether the assemble
            operation should be added to the graph. If not present, the original functionality
            of dolfinx is used without any additional functionalities.

    Returns:
        float: The computed scalar on the calling rank

    Note:
        When a form is assembled into a scalar value, the information about its dependencies is lost,
        and the resulting scalar does not support automatic differentiation. To this end
        the graph is used to keep track of the dependencies between the resulting scalar value and the
        used form to obtain the scalar value.
