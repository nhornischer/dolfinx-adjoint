    Note:
        When a form is assembled into a scalar value, the information about its dependencies is lost, 
        and the resulting scalar does not support automatic differentiation. To this end
        the graph is used to keep track of the dependencies between the resulting scalar value and the
        used form to obtain the scalar value.
